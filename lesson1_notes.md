1. Do you need these for deep learning?  

   - Lots of math T / F
   - Lots of data T / F
   - Lots of expensive computers T / F
   - A PhD T / F  

   Ans: F, F, F, F respectively. Thought it seems lots of data is good thing as long as these data are proper datasets.
   
1. Name five areas where deep learning is now the best in the world.  

   Ans: Image recognition, text translation, healthcare, recommendtation systems, and Genome analysis to name a few...

1. What was the name of the first device that was based on the principle of the artificial neuron?  
   
   Ans: Perceptron, or Mark I Perceptron.

1. Based on the book of the same name, what are the requirements for parallel distributed processing (PDP)?
   
   Ans:  
   A set of processing units  
   A state of activation  
   An output function for each unit  
   A pattern of connectivity among units  
   A propagation rule for propagating patterns of activities through the network of connectivities
   An activation rule for combining the inputs impinging on a unit with the current state of that unit to produce an output for the unit  
   A learning rule whereby patterns of connectivity are modified by experience  
   An environment within which the system must operate  


1. What were the two theoretical misunderstandings that held back the field of neural networks?
   Ans:  
   - One layer neural nets cannot approximate even simple functions, e.g. XOR, thus neural nets aren't usable in real situations, which is kinda misleading because adding layers may solve the situation in theory.    
   - Neural nets can do anything by adding more and more layers (two layers can approximate any kinda functions in theory), which was not necessarily the case considering computational complexity back in the day until the end of *Second AI Winter*.  

1. What is a GPU?
   Ans:
   It stands for Graphics Processing Unit, which was originally used for game graphics. Later on, it turns out GPU is also applicable even in machine learning tasks, since GPU has way more processing units than CPU, enabling pararell processing in many small units in learning tasks.

1. Open a notebook and execute a cell containing: `1+1`. What happens?
   Ans: It gives me 2, which is the result of calculation 1+1 by Python.  
1. Follow through each cell of the stripped version of the notebook for this chapter. Before executing each cell, guess what will happen.
1. Complete the Jupyter Notebook online appendix.
